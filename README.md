# KnowMDD

The dataset we used is the data of the REST-meta-MDD Project from DIRECT Consortium, which you can download from: https://www.scidb.cn/en/detail?dataSetId=cbeb3c7124bf47a6af7b3236a3aaf3a8.

To replicate our results, you should put the downloaded data into a new 'data' folder and run the following two steps
1. run the Make_FC_data.py
2. run the main.py
